This web app shows how many commute trips are performed by bike within Bay Area counties, places, and traffic analysis zones (TAZs). The data comes from the 2011 - 2015 American community survey (ACS). Commutes are counted roundtrip and have to either start or end at a location. This should give an indication of total commute trips in an area per day.

Future work on this app includes features for planning bycycle infrastrudture.

This web app is inspired by the [Propensity to Cycle Tool](https://www.pct.bike/) (PCT) for England and Wales.
